 <Comment>You have come across the coolest Japanese fire truck you will ever had the chance to own! Fully street legal and titled in Colorado. This 1993 Toyota Dyna Turbo Diesel Fire Engine Pump Truck has only 16k Kilometers and the condition shows it. 5-Speed Manual, 4 Wheel Drive with Locking Differentials. How cool!</Comment>

 <Comment>Yes, this ONE OWNER 1997 Eagle Talon ESi has only 9500 Miles! It has been garage kept and every inch of the condition shows it. Not much more to say then that. We completely inspected the vehicle and did a timing belt service, tires and anything else it needed.</Comment>
